			<h2>Introduction</h2>
            In the realm of web development, choosing the right framework can make all the difference. While there are many options available, Flask stands out as a lightweight yet powerful framework that empowers developers to build web applications with ease. In this blog post, we'll delve into the world of Flask, exploring its features, benefits, and why it's a favorite among developers.

    <section>
        <h2>
            What is Flask?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It's designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers alike. Despite its minimalistic approach, Flask offers a wide range of features and extensions that enable developers to create robust and scalable web applications.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
     <ul>   Minimalistic Design: Flask follows the "micro" philosophy, meaning it provides only the essentials for web development without imposing any unnecessary restrictions or dependencies. This allows developers to have more control over their projects and choose the components they need.
    </ul>
<ul>Routing: Flask uses a simple and intuitive routing system that maps URLs to view functions, making it easy to define routes and handle HTTP requests.
</ul>
<ul>Template Engine: Flask comes with a built-in template engine called Jinja2, which allows developers to create dynamic HTML pages by embedding Python code directly into the templates.
</ul>
<ul>Lightweight and Extensible: While Flask itself is lightweight, it can be easily extended with various Flask extensions and third-party libraries to add additional functionality, such as authentication, database integration, and more.
</ul>
<ul>Built-in Development Server: Flask includes a development server that makes it easy to run and test applications locally during the development process.
</ul>

        <strong>Benefits of Using Flask:
        </strong>
        <ul>Rapid Development: Flask's simplicity and ease of use enable developers to quickly prototype and build web applications without getting bogged down by unnecessary complexity.
        </ul>
        <ul>Flexible and Customizable: Flask's modular design allows developers to customize and extend the framework to suit their specific needs, making it adaptable to a wide range of projects and use cases.
        </ul>
        <ul>Pythonic: As a Python-based framework, Flask leverages the simplicity, readability, and versatility of the Python language, making it familiar and accessible to Python developers.
        </ul>
        <ul>Scalable: Despite its lightweight nature, Flask is capable of handling complex and high-traffic web applications with ease, thanks to its support for various extensions and deployment options.
        </ul>
        <ul>Active Community: Flask boasts a vibrant and active community of developers who contribute to the framework's development, create useful extensions, and provide support and resources for fellow Flask enthusiasts.
        </ul>

        <h2>Install Flask</h2>
        <p>Install Flask:
            If you haven't already installed Flask, you can do so using pip, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:</p>
        <strong>
            pip install Flask
        </strong>
<h2>Create Flask Application:</h2>
        <p>
            Create a new Python script (app.py) in a directory of your choice. Copy and paste the following code into the script:</p>
        </section>
        <p>
 <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
            """"
            from flask import Flask, render_template
            app = Flask(__name__)
            @app.route('/')
            def index():
                greeting = "Hello, Flask!"
                return render_template('index.html', greeting=greeting)

            if __name__ == '__main__':
                app.run(debug=True)

    </code>
    </pre>
        </p>
<section>
    <h2>Create HTML Template:</h2>
    <p>
        Inside the same directory, create a new folder named templates. Within the templates folder, create an HTML file named index.html. Copy and paste the following HTML code into index.html:</p>
    
</section>
    </main>
    
</body>
</html>
